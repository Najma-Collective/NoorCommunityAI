      <description>
Start with a simple, relatable question: "Think about something you learned when you were younger - maybe a language, a sport, or a musical instrument. How does that learning help you today? Take a moment to think about it."

Then transition: "Today we're going to learn how to connect the past and present in English. We'll use mixed conditionals to talk about how past decisions affect us now, or how our present situation explains past actions. It's useful and not as complicated as it sounds!"

    <stage name="Pre task A (Activate)" order="2">
      <description>
Activate prior knowledge about cause and effect across time. Use carousel with accessible questions:

Card 1: "Think about a skill you wish you had learned earlier. How would your life be different now?"

Card 2: "Is there a hobby or activity you stopped doing? What would have happened if you had continued?"

Card 3: "Think about a decision you made in the past. How does it affect your life today?"

These questions naturally elicit mixed conditional thinking (mixing past and present timeframes).

Follow up with simple questions:
- "When did you make that choice?" (Focus on time - past or present)
- "What's the result now?" (Or "What was the result then?")
- "Do you wish things were different?"

Listen for how they express these time relationships. They might use simple past or present - that's okay! This shows what they need to learn.

      <dialogue>
        <title>Old Friends Catching Up</title>
        <context>Two former university friends, Zainab and Karim, meet at a coffee shop after several years.</context>
        <speaker name="Zainab">
Karim! Is that you? I haven't seen you in ages!
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Karim">
Zainab! Wow, how long has it been? Five years? What have you been up to?
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Zainab">
At least five years! I'm working as a teacher now. You know, if I had studied engineering like I planned, I wouldn't be teaching now. But I'm actually really happy with this path.
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Karim">
That's great! I remember you were always good at explaining things to us. I'm working in IT now. If I had known programming was this interesting, I would have started learning it much earlier in university.
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Zainab">
You always liked computers! Hey, do you still play guitar? You were really good!
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Karim">
Not much anymore, sadly. If I weren't so busy with work, I would have continued taking lessons. I kind of miss it. What about you? Are you still doing photography?
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Zainab">
A little bit! Actually, if I had taken that photography course in Dubai two years ago, I would be doing it professionally now. But teaching takes up most of my time. No regrets though - I love my students!
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Karim">
That's awesome. You know what? If I were more organized, I would have kept in touch with more friends from university. We should meet up more often!
        </speaker>
        <speaker name="Zainab">
Definitely! Let's not wait another five years.
        </speaker>
      </dialogue>

      <conceptChecks>
After presenting the dialogue, use concept check questions:

- "Zainab says 'If I had studied engineering, I wouldn't be teaching now.' When did she make that choice?" (Past - when she chose her university major)
- "What's the result of that choice?" (Present - she's a teacher now, not an engineer)
- "Notice: past action → present result. This is a mixed conditional!"

- "Karim says 'If I weren't so busy with work, I would have continued taking lessons.' What's his condition?" (Present - he's busy now)
- "What's the result?" (Past - he didn't continue lessons)
- "This one is reversed! Present situation → past result."

Use notice boxes to show how mixing time frames helps us connect past decisions with present reality, or explain how our present situation affected past actions.

        <structure>Mixed Conditionals</structure>
        <form>Mixing time frames: past with present, or present with past</form>

        <explanation>
Present the grammar using CARD layout:

**Card 1: Review of Standard Conditionals**

Before we mix them, let's recall the standard forms:

Second Conditional (unreal present):
- If + past simple, would + base verb
- "If I had time, I would travel more." (But I don't have time now)

Third Conditional (unreal past):
- If + past perfect, would have + past participle
- "If I had studied harder, I would have passed." (But I didn't study harder, and I didn't pass)

Notice box: "These match time frames: present condition → present result, or past condition → past result."

**Card 2: Mixed Conditional Type 1 - PAST condition → PRESENT result**

Form: If + past perfect, would + base verb

Use when: A past action (or lack of action) has a result that is still true now.

Examples:
- "If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now."
  (I didn't study medicine [past], so I'm not a doctor [present result])

- "If they had invested in that company, they would be rich today."
  (They didn't invest [past], so they're not rich [present])

- "If she hadn't met her husband at university, she wouldn't be living in France now."
  (She did meet him [past], so she is living in France [present result])

Notice box: "Use this when you want to connect a past event to your present reality. It's about REGRET, REFLECTION, or GRATITUDE for how the past shaped the present."

**Card 3: Mixed Conditional Type 2 - PRESENT condition → PAST result**

Form: If + past simple, would have + past participle

Use when: A present situation would have changed a past event.

Examples:
- "If I were more organized, I wouldn't have missed the deadline."
  (I'm not organized [present characteristic], so I missed it [past result])

- "If he weren't so stubborn, he would have apologized yesterday."
  (He is stubborn [present trait], so he didn't apologize [past])

- "If we didn't live so far away, we would have visited them last weekend."
  (We do live far away [present fact], so we didn't visit [past])

Notice box: "Use this when a present characteristic or situation explains why something happened (or didn't happen) in the past."

**Card 4: Timeline Visualization**

Use learning card with visual description:

Mixed Type 1: PAST ────────────► NOW
             (condition)      (result)
"If I had saved money then, I would be wealthy now."

Mixed Type 2: NOW ────────────► PAST
             (condition)      (result)
"If I were braver, I would have spoken up yesterday."

**Card 5: Common Situations for Mixed Conditionals**

Use carousel of example contexts:

Card A: Career choices
"If I had chosen a different major, I would be in a different career now."

Card B: Relationships
"If we hadn't moved to this city, we wouldn't know our best friends."

Card C: Skills
"If I had practiced piano as a child, I would be able to play now."

Card D: Personality affecting past
"If I weren't so introverted, I would have joined more clubs in university."

**Card 6: Questions and Negatives**

Questions:
- "If you had taken that job, where would you be now?"
- "If you were more confident, what would you have done differently?"

Negatives (notice the double negative logic):
- "If I hadn't learned English, I wouldn't be here now." (I did learn it, so I am here)
- "If she didn't have anxiety, she wouldn't have avoided the interview." (She does have it, so she did avoid it)
        </explanation>

        <examples>
Provide multiple nuanced examples using learning cards:

**Real-life reflections:**
- "If I had learned to code earlier, I would have better job opportunities now."
- "If my grandparents hadn't emigrated, I wouldn't be living in this country today."
- "If I were more spontaneous, I would have said yes to that adventure last year."
- "If the pandemic hadn't happened, we would still be working in the office every day."

**Philosophical thinking:**
- "If humans hadn't invented smartphones, would we be happier now?"
- "If I were more decisive, would I have regretted fewer choices in my life?"

        <feature>Weak forms and contractions in mixed conditionals, plus thought groups</feature>

        <guidance>
Use think prompts: "Mixed conditionals are long sentences. Native speakers use rhythm and pausing to make them clear..."

**Focus areas:**

1. **Contractions** (essential for natural flow):
   - would → 'd: "I'd be" /aɪd biː/
   - would not → wouldn't: "wouldn't be" /ˈwʊdnt biː/
   - had → 'd: "If I'd known" /ɪf aɪd nəʊn/

2. **Weak forms**:
   - 'have' in past perfect: /həv/ not /hæv/
   - "If I had known" → "If I'd known" /ɪf aɪd nəʊn/

3. **Thought groups** (pausing for meaning):
   "If I had studied medicine, [PAUSE] I would be a doctor now."
   - Pause after the 'if' clause to separate past from present

4. **Stress patterns**:
   Stress the content words (actions, states), not grammar words:
   "If I had STUDIED medicine, I would BE a doctor NOW."

Model examples in dialogue boxes:
- "If I'd saved money then, I'd be rich now."
- "If I weren't so busy, I would've called you yesterday."

Then have student practice with emphasis on natural rhythm and pausing.

**Present → Past (Mixed Type 2):**
- "If I were ___ [present trait], I would have ___ [past]"
- "If I weren't so ___ [present], I wouldn't have ___ [past]"

**Question stems:**
- "Where would you be now if ___?"
- "What would have happened if ___?"

    <stage name="Main Task" order="7">
      <activity>
        <description>
Have a natural, friendly conversation. Start with a light question:

"What's something you're good at now because you learned it when you were younger?"

As they share, ask follow-up questions that elicit mixed conditionals:
- "If you hadn't learned that, what would be different about your life now?"
- "Is there something you do now that stopped you from doing something in the past?"
- "If you had more time, what would you have done differently?"

Also share your own examples (you can make them up!) to keep the conversation natural and model the language.

Monitor for these common errors WITHOUT interrupting:
- Using simple past instead of past perfect: "If I studied harder..." instead of "If I had studied harder..."
- Not mixing time frames: "If I had more time, I would have gone" (this is a standard third conditional, not mixed)
- Incorrect verb forms

Keep it conversational and light. B2 students can express complex ideas, but they don't need deep philosophical discussions in a grammar lesson!

    <stage name="Reporting" order="8">
      <reflection>
Use self-assessment widget and metacognitive questions:

"How comfortable do you feel with mixed conditionals now? They're complex even for advanced learners."

Deeper reflection questions:
- "When you were speaking, did you catch yourself thinking about time? Past vs present?"
- "Which type felt more natural: past→present or present→past?"
- "Did this conversation make you think about your life differently?"
- "Was there a moment where you wanted to say something complex but didn't have the language? What was it?"
      </reflection>
    </stage>

    <stage name="Feedback" order="9">
      <feedbackGuidance>
Focus on 2-3 priority areas. Mixed conditionals are tricky, so be encouraging and specific.

Use varied correction strategies:

**If they mixed up time frames:**
Use a simple card with notice box:
"You said: 'If I studied harder, I would be successful now.'
Good try! But we need past perfect here. Since you're talking about something in the past (when you were in school), use: 'If I had studied harder, I would be successful now.'

The 'had' shows the condition is in the past, but the result is in the present."

**If they used a standard conditional instead of mixed:**
Use recast + brief explanation:
Student: "If I had saved money, I would have been rich."
You: "Close! Actually, if you saved money back then, you would be rich now, right? Notice: the result is still true today, so we say 'you would be rich' (not 'would have been rich')."

**Positive feedback example:**
✨ "Great job using 'If I hadn't learned English, I wouldn't have this job now' - you connected past and present perfectly!"

**Goal for next time:**
Listen for mixed conditionals in English videos or conversations. People use them when talking about how past decisions affect them now. Try to notice 2-3 examples this week!

End with encouragement:
"You did really well today! Mixed conditionals help you talk about your life story in a natural way. Keep practicing and you'll use them without thinking!"

  <culturalContext>
Different cultures have different relationships with regret, reflection, and discussing "what if" scenarios. Some cultures embrace this kind of reflection; others find it uncomfortable or even taboo. Be sensitive to this.

Also, be mindful that discussing "choices" assumes agency - not everyone has had equal opportunities to choose their path. Frame questions inclusively, acknowledging systemic factors when relevant.

This lesson can become deeply personal. Create a safe space and let students share what they're comfortable with.
